  This is a technology demonstrator of a search interface to the Competency Explorer developed between 2020â€“2023 that is limited to 1,000 containers, with containers coming from three registries using three different competency schemas:

<p class="lead">
  <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered d-inline-block">
    <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
      <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
        <span class="fw-bold">Credential Engine Registry</span> using CTDL-ASN
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
      <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
        <span class="fw-bold">Desire2Learn</span> using ASN
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
      <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
        <span class="fw-bold">IMS Global Case Network</span> using CASE
      </div>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

  A metamodel interchange API is used to translate between the schemas, so that each container is available in its native schema or in both of the other two. These options are found via a download button located at the bottom, right of each competency container detail page.

  The 300 containers are limited to four industries. To explore the prototype, use one of these keywords: manufacturing, industry, agriculture, or culinary. The search index for this prototype includes Competency statements, Competency Names, and Descriptions.
